Analysis for the charts:
Average Minimum Temperature by Month 
#X-axis: Represents the months of the year (from 1 to 12).
#Y-axis: Shows the average minimum temperature in Celsius.

March (3) has the lowest average temperature, just below -80째C.June and July (6 and 7) show the highest average temperatures, close to -65째C.Temperatures vary significantly between months, with a general trend of lower temperatures in the early months of the year and higher ones around mid-year.


Average Pressure by Month
#X-axis: Represents the months of the year (from 1 to 12).
#Y-axis: Shows the atmospheric pressure in a range from around 700 to 900 units.
#Pressure tends to be highest in September (9), reaching nearly 900 units, and lowest in June (6), falling to around 750 units.The chart shows a cyclical pattern in atmospheric pressure with noticeable peaks and valleys, suggesting seasonal variations in atmospheric conditions.

Year Length
#X-axis: Represents the months of the year (from 1 to 12).
#Y-axis: Shows the atmospheric pressure in a range from around 700 to 900 units.

The chart shows a cyclical pattern in atmospheric pressure with noticeable peaks and valleys, suggesting seasonal variations in atmospheric conditions.
The regularity of the cycles implies a consistent, predictable climate cycle (possibly seasonal).
The temperature fluctuates between -65째C at the peaks and -85째C at the troughs, with the whole cycle repeating roughly every 500 days.
